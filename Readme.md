## Installation

For Installation i recommend to use a Browseraddon like "Tamper Monkey" (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
TamperMonkey allows to sideloade a Script into a website, which we use to modify the website.

- Step 1
Download and Install Tampermonkey
Tampermonkey requires you to set your Browser into Developer Mode

- Step 2
Copy the Code of the latest APModCookieClicker.js into your clipboard

- Step 3
Go to the CookieClicker Website and check if Tamper Monkey is installed and activated

- Step 4
Create a new userscript where you delete any code in and replace it with the Code from APModCookieClicker.js
